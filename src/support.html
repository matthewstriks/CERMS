      <h3>How to's</h3>
      <p>Below is a manual for CERMS. It should be used as a guide to learn how to use the system</p>
      <p>Every page has a navigation bar at the top to assist with moving to the different features of the application.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Home Page</h4>

      <p>This page opens on login. Here, you will have a view of everyone who checked in. When a member is checked in they will
      show their rental in a list view. You can see information such as the rental number, rental type, last name, first name,
      and time remaining. You also have a few action buttons where you can manage the rental.</p>

      <p>To renew a member's rental and add more time, click the "renew" button. To check out a member, click the "check out"
      button and follow the prompts. To edit a rental, click the "view info" button and then "edit rental" and follow the
      prompts. You may also add a member to the waitlist, which will apply a time icon next to their rental for your reference
      later.</p>

      <p>You will also notice an icon of a person leaving (or entering a door) next to the action buttons. This will toggle an
      icon to show if the person is currently gone or still at the facility.</p>
      
      <br>
      <h4>Members Page</h4>
      <p>This page includes a secondary navigation bar directly under the standard navigation bar. Your first option in the
      secondary navigation bar is to <b>create a member</b>. After clicking this, you will be redirected to a membership
      creation form. More information about that later on.</p>

      <p>You can view all Do Not Admit (DNA) members by clicking the "View DNA" button. The last option on the secondary
      navigation bar is to "Scan ID". After clicking, you can scan an ID and search for a member based on their ID. Please
      read the Scanning ID section later on for more information.</p>

      <p>Next, on this page, you will see a search bar. Here, you can search for members based on their first or last name,
      membership ID, or state ID number. Type in the search bar and click the Enter button to execute the search. You will see
      the list view below change to show the search results.</p>

      <p>The central portion of the page is the members list view. Here, you will see some recently added members to the system.
      You can search for any member in the database but will only see entries from the previous couple of days to save on
      loading time. In the list view, you can see the member's name, Date of Birth (or DOB), membership type, when the
      membership expires, and action buttons. Your first action button is the "Check-In" button. After clicking this button,
      you can enter some rental information and proceed to the order page (more information is below under the Order Page).
      Checking the "Add to waitlist" box will add the time icon to the home page, as discussed above. The next action button
      is the "View Member" button. Here, you can see all the information about the member. You have additional action buttons
      with "Create Order" and "Member History" options. Clicking the "Create Order" button will bring you to the order page
      and link the order to the member's account. Viewing member history will show you the recent activity of that specific
      member. Your last action button is the "Edit Member" button. Here, you can edit all information about the member. If you
      change the "Type of Membership" field, you will be brought to the order page, where the member must be charged for a new
      membership. You also have more action buttons including "Delete Member", "Do Not Admit", and "Tag". If you have
      permission, you may delete the member from the system. This is not recommended as it may cause errors later in the
      system; however, if a membership is created accidentally, you may delete it. "Do Not Admit" will block the member from
      checking in. Often paired with notes, other employees cannot check this member in. If the member is already on the DNA
      list, this button will say "Admit", and clicking it will take them off the DNA list. Clicking the "Tag" button will
      ensure that when another employee checks in a member, they read the member notes. Employees must check a box certifying
      they read the member notes before checking them in.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Quick Sale Page</h4>
      <p>This page is called the <b>Order Page</b>. You have two sections: the products side and the order card. On the products
      side, you have all the business's products listed for sale. Products, rentals, and memberships typically. You will see a
      search box at the top of the products section. You can open that search box and start searching for products. You can
      also click the search box and scan a barcode. If using the scanner, the product will automatically be added to the order
      card (scan again to add more). Below that, you have a box that will show favorite items set up by the managers. These
      are your frequently used products. The rest are categories set by your managers. Click a category to open and see the
      products. Products may have images to help identify them. You can click the image to add the product to the order card.</p>

      <p>On the order card, at the bottom, you will see different options. "Add discount to entire order" will allow you to enter
      a discount code customers may have (set by managers) and will apply to the entire order (See discounts section under the
      product page information for more). You then have the option to "Clear", "Suspend", and "Checkout". "Clear" will get rid
      of all products on the order card. "Suspend" will allow you to "pause" the order. After clicking, you can return to the
      member's page and complete other "transactions". You can then return to the quick sale page (or stay on the order screen
      if you were taken there) and click "Resume" to return to the original order and apply the other transactions. This is
      best used when a group comes in, and one person pays. You can check multiple people in and have it all in one order.
      When you click "Quick Sale" from the navigation to enter the order page, you will see "Quick Sale" on the top of the
      order card. This means there is no direct customer assigned to the order. If you get transferred to the order page by
      checking a member in or creating an order based on a member, it will have the member's name. NOTE: The original order
      card member will be the "customer" for the transaction. For example, if I check in John Doe and click suspend, when I
      check other members in and click "Resume", John Doe will be the primary customer for the order and will be listed as the
      one buying it. When you click "Checkout," you will see a receipt-style list of all the products in the order. You will
      see subtotal, tax, and total. You will then see a large "Total Left: $X.XX" text showing you the balance. You then have
      three options to disperse payment (Credit Card, Cash, and Gift Card). Double-clicking inside one of those boxes will
      auto-submit the balance left to make the process quicker. If they pay cash and the amount exceeds what is left, you will
      see how much change they need back. Click finish (after inputting the total balance) to continue. You will then have the
      option to "Print", "Email", "Both", or choose no receipt needed. You may have to enter the member's email to complete
      the email receipt. You will then be taken home.</p>

      <p>On each product in the order card, you will have some options. The "+" button next to the name will add another one of
      those products to the order. The trash can icon will remove it (or one if you have multiple). The tag icon will allow
      you to enter a discount code for that individual product (See the discounts section under the product page information
      for more). After clicking the tag icon, you also have the option (if a manager gives permission) to "Waive" the item.
      Waiving the item will make the balance for that item $0.00 and should only be used if authorized by a manager.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Register Page</h4>
      <p>On this page, you can create and manage registers. Click "Open Personal Register" to get started. You will then input
      how much money your register is starting with and select a shift. Only one drawer can be opened per shift, so you may
      need to choose "no shift assigned" if you are an extra. Managers can close open registers. There is also an option to
      "Generate report now". This will start the report at 7 am (the current day) and save a report with all the information
      wherever reports are set to save for your machine. When you have a register open, you will have the option to "Close
      Register". After clicking this, you can count down your drawer and input your credit card sales. When you close a
      register, a register report will be generated with all the information from your sales. If you are opening a day shift
      drawer, the report from the previous day will be generated.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>History Page</h4>
      <p>On this page, you can view records that have already been closed out. Opening the page will start you off on the
      Activity History. You can toggle between activity and order history by clicking the "View" dropdown. You will also see a
      search bar where you can search through records.</p>
      
      <p>On the activity history page, you will see a list view of all members who were checked in. Name, Rental Info, Time In,
      Time Out, and Duration will show in the list. You will also have an action button to view the member from this page.</p>
      
      <p>You will see a list view of all orders on the order history page. Order Number, Date/Time, Amount, and Customer will
      show. You will have two action buttons on this page for each entry. "View Member" will show you the customer
      information, and "View Order" will display the receipt of the order.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Analytics Page</h4>
      <p>You will see various charts and graphs with different information on the analytics page. To get started, enter a start
      date/time and end date/time and click "Run Analytics".</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Account Page</h4>
      <p>On the accounts page, you will see various options to configure your program. Most options need manager permission to
      alter. You will see a display of your business name, display name, and rank. You can click the "Check for update" button
      to check for a system update. NOTE: System updates will automatically be checked/installed on the login screen to ensure
      you use the best application version.</p>
      
      <p>Options to configure include Report Save Directory (select where register reports get saved to based on your computer),
      Where to send inventory warn emails (who gets emails about inventory being low), Time to add when renew button is
      clicked in hours (deprecated) Quickbooks connect (still in pre-beta) Receipt (alter how the receipt looks) Register
      Receipt (alter how the register receipt looks). You will also have options for user accounts. 'Change password" will
      allow you to change your password, "Create new account" will allow you to create a new account, and "Edit account" will
      allow you to alter an account.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Products Page</h4>
      <p>On this page, you can edit products for the system. You will be able to edit "Categories", "Products", and "Discounts".</p>

      <p>Categories can be created and edited. You will see a list view of all categories with the name, description, and action
      buttons to edit or remove them. When you click the "Add Category" button, a form will pop up asking for the new category
      name, description, and color. Make sure you choose a color you can see with black writing on top for best results.</p>
      
      <p>Products can be created and edited. You will see a list view of all products with the name, price, inventory warning,
      description, current inventory, and action buttons to edit or remove them. You also can search for products on this page
      by name or description. When you click the "Add Product" button, a form will pop up asking for the new product category,
      name, barcode (click in the text box and scan the product to add), price, inventory warning (the inventory number when
      an email will trigger), description, current inventory ammount, inventory par (how much should be in stock), and
      multiple checkboxes;</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Favorite - Show up in the favorite category on the order page</li>
        <li>Taxable - Should taxes be applied to this item</li>
        <li>Active - Is the product active (MUST BE CHECKED TO SHOW ON THE ORDER PAGE)</li>
        <li>Core - Is this a core product (different permissions to edit)</li>
        <li>Rental - Should this show up as a rental option (You will also select how long it lasts)</li>
        <li>Membership - Should this show up as a rental option (You will also determine how long it lasts)</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>Discounts can be created and edited. You will see a list view of all discounts with the code, discount type, amount,
      expiration date/time, and action buttons to edit or remove them. When you click the "Add Discount Code" button, a form
      will pop up asking for the new discount code (case sensitive), type (product or order discount), dollar/percent amount,
      limits (limit the usage of the code to a restricted amount of times), how many times has it been used already, and
      expire date.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Membership Creation Page</h4>
      <p>When creating a member, you will fill out a form on the system with the member information. Name (first and last), Date
      of Birth (or DOB), EMail (optional), Type of Membership, ID State (passport, military, other are all options as well),
      ID Number, Guest Notes (optional), Waiver Signed checkbox. If a birthday is entered and the member is under 18, you will
      see three baby icons indicating they are under 18. You can scan an ID to input the member's name, DOB, and ID
      information (state and number). See directions on how to scan an ID.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>Scanning ID's</h4>
      <p>When searching for a member on the member's page or creating one, you will see a "Scan ID" button. You will have to
      select the ID state, and you will then see an empty text box pop up. Make sure you are inputting into that text box by
      clicking on it. Scan the ID (Note: many IDs have multiple barcodes on the back. Ensure you scan the correct one, usually
      the biggest, to ensure you gather the correct information). Wait a few moments to ensure your scanner has inputted all
      the data (This may take up to 30 seconds or longer). Click the "Scan ID" button again to submit the data. Wait until the
      information is inputted. Verify the information is correct, then you may move on.</p>
      
      <p><b>NOTE: This system does not run ID's through a background check. The system translates information about the ID
      (things you can visually observe yourself) and inputs it for you, saving time. You still need to verify the ID is
      real, as some fake IDs will still scan appropriately.</b></p>
